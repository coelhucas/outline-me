# Outline me

## About
I got the habit of using outline.com to read articles without noise but I'm too lazy to keep going to its website and pasting the link, so I made this in a way that we all can quickly be redirected to an "outlined" version of the article.

## Using
After installing this extension, you can use:

`⌘⇧O` - macOS

`⌃⇧O` - win/linux
To be redirected to an outline.com/active-tab-url

## Disclaimer
I noticed after creating it that there's already an extension for it. But [I regret nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here).
