## About
I got the habit of using outline.com to read articles without noise but I'm too lazy to keep going to outline to paste an article's link, so I made this in a way that we all can quickly be redirected to an "outlined" version of the article.

P.S.: This can also save you from some paywalls ðŸ‘€

## Using
After installing this extension, you can use:

<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>â‡§</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd> - macOS*

<kbd>âŒƒ</kbd> + <kbd>â‡§</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd> - Win/Linux*

To be redirected to an outline.com/active-tab-url

Shortcuts use <kbd>âŽ‡</kbd> | <kbd>âŒ¥</kbd> (**alt**ernative|option key) in Firefox version.

## Disclaimer
I noticed after creating it that there's already an extension for it. But [I regret nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here).
